1. rm -rf .git __ makes the directory a non git repository

2. git log -p __ Ye mujhe commits ke saath saath ye bhi dikhayega ke what are the changes that have been made
                          i.e. commits along with their [diff]

3. git log -p -k __ Shows the last 'k' number of commits from __git log -p
    ))))--------------example:   git log -p -3 :  shows the last 3 commits

4. git log --stat __ Shows us in brief(summary) about the commits made to the repository

5. git log --pretty=oneline __ Shows the commits with their corresponding messages in one line.

6. git log --pretty=short __ Shows the authors along with commit messages.

7. git log --pretty=full __ Shows the commiter along with their authors and messages.

      [Author is the one who has first created the file whereas the committter is the one who has made some changes to it.]

8. git log --since=2.days/2.months/4.years __ Shows the commits which have been since the specified duration.

9. git commit --amend __VERY IMPORTANT COMMAND__>> This command lets us merge the changes made by us to the file
					                   and also allowing us to change the commit message given by the
					                  author at the same time
 
10. git rm --cached second.txt __ >> This command lets us untrack an existingly tracked file. [VERY IMPORTANT]
			
			                 example: Adding an already tracked file in .gitignore doesn't ignore the file unless we have explicitly
			                 untracked that tracked file. 

11. git mv second1.txt second2.txt __>> Lets us rename a file.

12. git push -u origin master__ Pushes the changes to the repository on github

13. git config --global alias.last 'log -p -1' __ Changes the command from 'log -p -1' to just 'last' [more or less a short hand version of command] {QUITE IMPORTANT}

                                                                  			BRANCHING THE DIRECTORIES

1. git checkout -b <branch name> __ Creates a new branch named <branch name> and -b is used because <branch name> branch doesn't exist already.

2. git checkout master __ Switches to the master branch
    git checkout <branch name> __ Switches to the <branch name> branch

						MERGING THE BRANCHES

1. git commit merge <branch name> __ We will write this in the master branch or the branch in which we want to merge the <branch name> branch

2. git commit -m "____" >>> This command finally merges the two branches

[MERGE CONFLICT]

If the two branches change the files in different ways, then the merge conflict arises, which can be easily resolved by choosing one of the two changes. Meanwhile most of the other changes
are resolved by the git merger automatically.
